title: ScotRUG Social in Glasgow
---

It has been at least 7 years since ScotRUG last ran in Glasgow. Some of the organising team are in town on Tuesday, and so we figured: let's do it again!

No speakers, just a social meetup; a chance to bring together Weegie Rubyists and also non-Weegie Rubyists for a blether. Maybe look to what we can do in Glasgow next year? There's plenty to talk about in Ruby-land right now.

Sign up [on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/312220308)!

### *Where and When?*
We'll be at the Raven on Renfield Street (that's right - Glasgow) from 18:00
