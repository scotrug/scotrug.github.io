title: Let's Rock It Like It's 2025

### *Where and When?*
Oh my gosh - it's 2025, and we haven't met up in _forever_. After Haggis Ruby last year, we've had _counts on hands_ one meeting this year. It's the longest break between meetups ever (don't let the website tell you otherwise). Anyway, with the summer winding down and the bounty of autumn heading our way, ScotRUG is back!

We'll be meeting at 18:00 on the 11th of September at [FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com/)'s offices [on Fountainbridge](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/10837044082) in Edinburgh.

### *What*

...a meetup, a presentation, some lovely chat with other Ruby folks, and some learning. More will be revealed soon!
