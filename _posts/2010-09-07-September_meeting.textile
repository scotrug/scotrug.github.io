By popular demand the next meeting will be an interactive session on "Ruby Koans":http://rubykoans.com/.  Bring your laptops for some fun coding.  Kickoff will be at 19:30 with a walkthrough.  Then we will pair up and code through some more.  We will have a debrief at the end followed (no doubt) by a visit to the Holyrood Tavern.

See you at "The Edinburgh Training Centre":http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&q=EH1+1SU&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF8&hl=en&hq=&hnear=Edinburgh+EH1+1SU,+United+Kingdom&z=15 on Thursday 16 September.
