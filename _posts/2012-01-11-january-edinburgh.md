title: January ScotRUG Edinburgh - 19 January
---

Thanks to strategic powercuts and other ridiculous problems, the December ScotRUG did not quite go to plan. But next week we will be back on form. We have 3 (3!!!) talks lined up, plus free (as in beer) beer from [FreeAgent](http://freeagent.com). Yay!

* [Ryan Stenhouse](https://twitter.com/ryanstenhouse) will be talking about cultural differences when programming people-facing applications 
* [Sam Elliott](https://twitter.com/lenary) will be taking us on a magical mystery tour of the more obscure (read exciting) corners of Ruby's core classes and Standard Lib.
* [Paul Wilson](https://twitter.com/paulanthonywils) will be giving a quick demo of Mountable Apps in Rails 3.1.x.
