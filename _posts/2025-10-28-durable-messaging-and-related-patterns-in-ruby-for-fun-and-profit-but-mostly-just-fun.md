title: Durable messaging and related patterns in Ruby, for fun and profit. But mostly just fun.
---

Hallowe'en is almost upon us - get ready for [the Samhuinn celebrations](https://beltane.org/about-samhuinn/), maybe carve yourself a neep as tradition suggests. And then? Why, then we have November. Time for another ScotRUG meetup in Edinburgh!

### *What & Who*
The wonderful [Ismael Celis](https://ismaelcelis.com/) is coming up from London to speak to us about a programming paradigm that's less used in Ruby: durable message logs. This leans into Ruby's functional programming aspects, links up with event sourcing, and is a great tool to have in your design toolbox.

### *Where and When?*
We're delighted to be hosted by [FreeAgent](https://freeagent.com) in November, and they are also supplying food and refreshments. This will be at [their office on Fountainbridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/StGTB9Sz6GdV7jao7), just behind the canal basin and next to the Tesco.

There will be a couple of friendly folks to let you upstairs until about 18:15

Agenda
* Doors open from 18:00 for socialising/networking
* Talk start about 18:30
* Finish the event by heading to a nearby pub, close to Haymarket train station before 20:00

Please [sign up on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/311744341/?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=announce_event&utm_source=link&utm_version=v2) so we have numbers for food.

See you then!
