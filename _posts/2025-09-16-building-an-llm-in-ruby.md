title: Building an LLM in Ruby
---

### *What*
September marked the resumption of ScotRUG in person meetups. It was great to see so many faces new and old! As the light continues to fade from the sky, and thoughts turn to the cooler days of the year, it's time to look forward to our October meet up. Meetups aren't all ScotRUG is about, but it is great to talk to folks in person.

This month we have talks brought to us by the fine people of [RubyNess](https://rubyness.co.uk/), on the topic of Large Language Models (LLMs).

First up, we have Gavin Morrice, who promises "How to build an LLM from scratch in Ruby", demonstrating the basic concepts, but in Ruby. Secondly, we have Sergey Sergyenko, who will talk about how you might use an LLM from a Ruby program.

And finally, bring your laptops! Sergey has an idea and needs some people with their development environment to demonstrate it.

### *Where and When?*
We'll meet, as we always do, on the second Thursday in October:

October 9th
Meetup start time: 18:00

As usual, we'll have time to socialise before and after. We'll confirm the venue next week, and give you the details of our lovely sponsors then too.

That's it! If you want to come along, please [RSVP on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/)
