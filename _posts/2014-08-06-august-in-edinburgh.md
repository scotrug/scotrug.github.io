title: 21st August Edinburgh Meetup
---

Evan Phoenix gave a [keynote at Scottish Ruby Conference](http://programme2014.scottishrubyconference.com/slots/3/video) this year about Reading Code.

So let's read some code!

Agenda:

- Come up with a list of gems or projects that we are interested in
- Break off into pairs/groups to dig into one of these
- Summarise what interesting things we found in the end


As we'll be going through actual code, the more laptops, tablets etc. in the room the better. We'll be in groups though so if you don't have anything with you, don't worry about it.
