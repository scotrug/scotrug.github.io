title: Ruby 4.0 - What's in the new Release?
---

The shining lights of the Christmas markets sparkle through the crisp nights, signifying the impending arrival of a new Ruby version. This year's release (scheduled for Christmas day) will be Ruby 4.0! Unusually, the major version number bump doesn't mean underlying language or interpreter changes though. And if that's intriguing, good!

It's time for our usual December "what's up with the new release?" chat, which we continue in the memory of Noah Gibbs. Noah was a member of the ScotRUG community, and used to work on YJIT.

### *Where and When?*
We'll be meeting on the 11th of December in the [Quaker Meeting House on Victoria Terrace](https://www.equaker.org.uk/).

*Agenda*

* 18:00 - meetup starts (social time!)
* 18:30 - Ruby 4 discussion time! And if we run out of discussions - more general Ruby chat
* 19:30ish - wrap up - decamp to pub/head home

### *What*
For the discussion, we'll likely break up into small groups. You can currently see [the notes for version 4.0-preview2](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v4_0_0_preview2/NEWS.md), and [download the preview 2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2025/11/17/ruby-4-0-0-preview2-released/) to play around with. Have a look at the updated core gems, the release, and bring your thoughts.

There aren't a huge number of obvious changes this year, so we'll have plenty of time for general discussions too!

[Sign up on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/312304613), and we'll see you there.
